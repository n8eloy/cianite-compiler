## Project Setup
Create new Netbeans or Eclipse Java project with external files. In Netbeans, select _Java > Java Project with Existing Sources_. If necessary, use ignored folders _netbeans-project/_ or _eclipse-project/_ to save local project files. All files inside _src/_ are ignored during commit, except _.java_ files.

### For testing
While configuring Project Run settings, set Working Directory as the project root directory (_cianite-compiler_) and add _test-files_ as an argument. Run project.

### For coding and publishing
- Use UTF-8 encoding on all files
- Directory _src_ is ready to be sent, as long as there are only _.java_ files in it
